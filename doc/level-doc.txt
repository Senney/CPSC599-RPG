Levels

Levels will specify the various textures that need to be loaded in to a map
before it can be rendered.

Levels are comprised of
    * Texture assets
    * Sound assets
    * Triggers
    * Game Objects
    * Game Object Linkings (e.g. Key->Door/Chest)

Levels do not contain these items however, simply specify their requirement
and designate a context in which they are to be used.
