        <Villager1>Hey, have you noticed? There’s been an increase in cows lately.</Villager1>
        <Villager2>You’ve noticed, too? It seems that no matter where I look these days, there’s always a cow there, staring strangely at me. Like it’s trying to consume my soul or something.</Villager2>
        <Villager1>Yeah, I know what you mean. It kind of feels like they’re slowly starting to take over our land.</Villager1>
        <Cow>Mooooo.</Cow>
        <Villager2>Look, there comes one now.</Villager2>
        <Cow>Moo moooo.</Cow>
        <Villager1>They’re coming closer! Let’s leave.</Villager1>
        <Cow>Mooooooooooo.</Cow>

        <System>Elsewhere, in a flowery field...</System>
        <Ren>Here, I want you to have this.</Ren>
        <System>Hikari received Orb Necklace!</System>
        <Hikari>...? What’s this for?</Hikari>
        <Ren>N-Nothing, really. I... I just wanted to say t-thanks.</Ren>
        <Hikari>Thanks for what?</Hikari>
        <Ren>Just. ...You know? Helping me out for all these years and stuff.</Ren>
        <Hikari>*laughs* You don’t need to say thanks for that. We’re friends! It’s normal for friends to help each other out.</Hikari>
        <Ren>Yeah, but... I just... You’ve really helped me out a lot. Before, when I had nobody to talk to, I was really lonely. But after I met you, it felt as though a light suddenly shone onto my world and brightened everything up. Things that I had hated before didn’t look so bad anymore once you were there. So, that’s why... Thank you.</Ren>
        <Hikari>.........</Hikari>
        <Hikari>You’re welcome.</Hikari>
        <Hikari>If there’s ever a time when you’re in trouble or something, just come to me. I’ll be there for you. I promised didn’t I? That I’d become your knight and protect you.</Hikari>
        <Ren>Hikari...</Ren>
