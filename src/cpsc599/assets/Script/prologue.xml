	<narrative>There exists an orb of legend that is said to bestow upon the one who wields it a power that could conquer the entire world. For centuries, people have believed in this legend and devoted their entire lives seeking for this orb, but even after generations upon generations struggled to find this orb, none so far have succeeded. And thus, it faded away in the annals of history until only a few even remembered about its existence. But what the people didn’t know was that it had been kept hidden by the royal family when word of its existence had first reached the people’s ears. The royal family had not wanted anyone to use the orb to overthrow their rule, and, unable to figure out how to utilize the power for themselves, decided to have it sealed and buried deep within their vaults. There it has remained until this day, waiting for the time its power would awaken.</narrative>
